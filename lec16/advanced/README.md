## N-queens tracking recursive calls

I have modified the `place_queen` function now to maintain a static variable
and write to file, the size of the board and the number of recursive calls made. 

After compiling, invoke the executable as 

```
./a.out N
```
where `N` is the size of the board (`>=4`). 

The output will be written out to a file called `queens.txt`.
